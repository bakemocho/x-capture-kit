# Safari Extension (Planned)

Planned approach:

1. Keep runtime capture logic in `core/x-clipper.js`
2. Reuse bridge pattern from `chrome-extension/`
3. Convert web extension project with Safari tooling
4. Add platform-specific packaging and release instructions

This folder is a placeholder for the Safari-specific implementation.
